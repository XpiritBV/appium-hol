# GEttign Started with APpium

This is the description on how to set up your machine so you can start testing applications

# Windows applications
Goto the Appium website and goto the section getting started.

<a href="http://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/getting-started/?lang=en">http://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/getting-started/?lang=en</a>

Follow the steps on installing the `Desktop App`

Select the download package for the windows platform:
<a href="https://github.com/appium/appium-desktop/releases">Appium Desktop App Releases</a>

At the moment of this writing the latest version for windows is Appium-windows-1.15.1.exe

After the installation start the Appium Desktop Application and specify the Ip Adress of the server you want to run, to be your localhost. So 127.0.0.1

Starting appium might take a while. So don't be impatient when you click the icon and don't see an UI immediately.

## Validate your installation
You can run the inspector that is part of the Appium Desktop client to start e.g. the windows forms application and then inspect it in the tool. This validates you have the windows Driver installed and that it can start your application.
